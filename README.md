# RiotJS - Precompiled Templates

Just a super simple [riotjs](http://riotjs.com/) example using [jspm](http://jspm.io) and ES6.

## Notes for myself

I had to manually map "riot-compiler", default "riot" doesn't ship with compiler (this is good).

Had to setup a jspm package so that the .html file extension could be used. Might have been able to use the ! syntax, but I think this is better.
